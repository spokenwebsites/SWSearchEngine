It was to begin at 1 p.m. today in the Ottawa Public Library auditorium, Metcalfe and Laurier.\nAuthor Mathews operates a traditional small publishing operation, Steel Rail Press, while poet Davey is founder of Swift Current, a computer network for writers. Most appropriately for them, the topic is 'Whither the Book?'\n'I have opposed the Mathews style of nationalism, Davey said earlier, 'because it assumes a single definition of Canadian culture. It seems to stem from a United Empire Loyalist tradition that may be valid in Ontario, but is not in the West.'\nDavey said he prefers a Diefenbaker-style 'community of communities ... an accumulation of regional artistic cultures.'\nMathews's traditional views reflect a central stream of Canadian literature and valid concerns--shared by Davey--about the nation's cultural survival. Steel Rail next month launches Ottawa poet Patrick White's long poem in honor of a Chilean leftist martyr, Homage to Victor Jara (paperback, $7.95). It includes translation into Spanish by Ottawa Cuban-Canadian Juan O'Neil.\nDo books, as we know them, have a future?\nDavey offers a radical view that publishers will lose their power to decide the number of copies, the type of paper and the cost of books as readers assume authority.\n'With the computer,' said Davey, 'you can actually send the text of the book to a bookstore and have the printing done there and the reader could determine there all the things decided by the publisher.'\nDavey said the bookstore printings to suit individuals could vary from cheap formats to some approaching medieval manuscripts in appeal and quality.\nCanada Council partly funds Swift Current, 'an electronic literary magazine' in which each of 40 Canadian writers edits his or her own contribution to the large data bank (Vax-750 operated by York University).\n'We offer every reader an option of deleting not only an individual work but an individual author from his or her own view of the data base,' said Davey. Writers participate free in return for their writing and editing work. The 40 subscribers, so far, pay $25 (individuals) or $100 (libraries and other institutions). For classroom study, subscribers can pay for printouts at three cents for 50 lines (about 60 cents for 20 pages)--'a nominal fee.'\nSwift Current gives regions and individuals an  escape from 'centralizing forces,' and Canadian writers a seawall against the flood of U.S. culture.\"\n\n", "type": "General"}], "Rights": {"rights": "Copyright Not Evaluated (CNE)", "rights_uri": "http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/CNE/1.0/"}, "Content": {"notes": "Contents entry temporary.

He attended UBC where he was one of the editors of a poetry newsletter, Tish, and later edited a poetry newsletter, Sum, at the University of New Mexico. He later attended the State University of New York at Buffalo where he was one of the editors of a poetry journal, Magazine of Further Studies. Since 1967, he has been teaching at Selkirk College in Castlegar. His immediate concerns are with an experimental first-year university program which he coordinates (Arts I), and also to map, in poems, the geography of the land which has played such a prominent part in his life. Fred has had two volumes of poetry published - Lardeau, in 1965, and Mountain, in 1967.
