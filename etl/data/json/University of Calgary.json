Long poem, Kerrisdale Elegies. Relationship with Rilke\u2019s Duino Elegies, a rewriting for Vancouver in the 80s. The work consists of ten elegies, George Bowering reads #4 and #10.\n- [00:01:04] Elegy #4. Interjection #1: This poems speak to him, which is a true story, he did hear his father\u2019s voice. Interjection #2: George Bowering chooses to skip over some French \u201cbecause it\u2019s so bad\u201d (no laughter heard). Interjection #3: Poetry described by someone as \u201cmusical thought,\u201d which George Bowering thought was \u201cless than apt\u201d\n- [00:08:59] Elegy #10. Relates to the concerns of the event \u2013 narrative influence. Interjection: \u201cReally uplifting stuff, huh? Really sad.\u201d\n- [00:18:55] Poem that George Bowering wants on his tombstone, \u201cOh lord if I have but one life to live, I hope this ain\u2019t it\u201d (laughter).\n- [00:19:25] Describes a new book of old poems, poems which are publically and socially oriented\n- [00:20:14] American Cops. Written mid to late 60s and published as a pamphlet prior to inclusion in poetry collection. Dedicated to John Sinclair. Discusses rock n roll political movements, MC5 in Detroit, the political party \u201cRainbow\u201d which started as the White Panthers. Driving through America as Canadians, unused to seeing guns. Resonates well with the audience (laughter).\n- [00:25:51] Robert Kroetsch introductory remarks. Called post-modern writer in Canada, speaking on narrative because of the event theme and the academic concerns of the students in the audience.\n- [00:26:48] Sketches of a Lemon. Wary of notions of meaning, tried to pick an object lacking inherent meaning. Interjection: there is a lemon tree, deconstructs his poem for him.\n- [00:30:45] Seed Catalogue introduction. Shared text/tradition of seed catalogues, must engage with great garden poetry from Book of Genesis onward. Cabbages as an unexplored entry point. Only two seasons in Canada: winter and poor sledding. Reckoning with the false notion of spring, need to reinterpret our engagement with preconceptions of seasons inherited from British tradition. Interjection #1: Robert Kroetsch did fall off a horse standing still, while also playing with concept of fallen man. Interjection #2: second section picking up on oral tradition, in light of books/media that doesn\u2019t reflect \u201cus\u201d (Canadians) we survive by telling each other stories. Laughter at father killing magpie. Interjection #3: Brome grass section came from telling a young female poet his difficulty in ending, and she told a Saskatchewan cowboy who sent a letter to Robert Kroetsch (the letter became the text).\n- [00:46:34] Four Questions for George George Bowering is a response to Kerrisdale Elegies. \n- [00:48:10] Question period. #1: George skipping over his bad French. How has multiple readings influenced their opinions of the poems \u2013 George Bowering: difference between composition and reading. Notation reflecting primary experience (reading). Explaining concept of notation. Robert Kroetsch: Movement away from speech model, dialoguing with George Bowering. #2: Prose and verse, is it clear which way a piece will go when writing. George Bowering: still imagines it being read out loud regardless of whether it is prose or verse. Robert Kroetsch: still reads as lyrical. Movement between writing the two is fluid.\n\n- * Dating determined to be approximately May 1986. Correspondence with Robert Kroetsch and Brian Edwards occurs only following the conference (591/96.6 4.42). George Bowering also corresponds with Edwards in 1984 and 1986 (correspondence housed at Library and Archives Canada). In the recording, a conference which Robert Kroetsch and George Bowering attended took place in Ottawa a \u201cthree weeks earlier\u201d can be dated to April 25-27, 1986 (591/96.6 34.8). In another interview with Edwards, Robert Kroetsch references this conference in May (775/04.25 29.2).\n", "contents": "George Bowering\n[00:01:04] \nPerforms \"Elegy Four\".\nGeorge Bowering\n[00:08:59]\nPerforms \"Elegy Ten\".\nGeorge Bowering\n[00:20:14]\nPerforms \"American Cops\". \nRobert Kroetsch\n[00:26:48]\nPerforms \"Sketches of a Lemon\". \nRobert Kroetsch \n[00:33:11]\nPerforms \"Seed Catalogue\".\nRobert Kroetsch \n[00:47:02]\n\"Four Questions for George Bowering\"."}, "Creators": [{"id": 1, "url": "http://viaf.org/viaf/120613489", "name": "Kroetsch, Robert", "role": [{"id": "66b38666610773.35823520", "value": "Author"}, {"id": "66b38666610c11.83222208", "value": "Performer"}], "dates": "1927-2011"}], "Location": [{"id": 1, "url": "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/details.html?osmtype=W&osmid=180360037&class=amenity", "venue": "Deakin University", "address": "221, Burwood Highway, Burwood, Victoria, Australia", "latitude": "-37.84751365", "longitude": "145.1149491"}], "Contributors": [{"id": 1, "url": "http://viaf.org/viaf/34469976", "name": "Bowering, George", "role": [{"id": "66b38666612c49.67767941", "value": "Author"}, {"id": "66b386666130a1.32909049", "value": "Performer"}], "dates": "1935-"}], "Related_Works": [{"id": 1, "citation": "Bowering, Kerrisdale Elegies (1984).

Crow served as inspiration during difficult writing period. Robert Kroetsch prefers magic realism instead of documentary style, finds documentary unnatural to him \u201cbecause I don\u2019t believe documents are documents, that they themselves are another version of unreality or imagination if you will.\u201d Versions of narrative operating through time, recovery of intermingling voices.\n- Stories of family are important, especially relationships with uncles and aunts because there is a necessary closeness and separation (don\u2019t have the binding structures found with parents).\n- Creative strategies: resisting authorized versions of Alberta (historical, political), recovering personal experience but mediated by words (oral tradition). A few words recover an entire narrative pattern.\n- Interruption and intervention: question of \u201cwhat is a reader?\u201d The reader has enormous body of narrative in their head which can be tapped into by process of intervention.\n- Influences: earlier texts use myths/stories. In Crow, attempt to let multiple narratives speak at once without privileging one. i.e. the perception of crows as negative in Western world, but is a smart, positive, trickster figure in Indigenous epistemologies.\n- Story doesn\u2019t exist until it is in the reader\u2019s mind? Robert Kroetsch has abandoned romantic notion of the writer/artist. Meta-textualism. \n- Brian: post-modern privileges the reader, reader is invited into the text. Robert Kroetsch: It is difficult and dangerous to be the reader, because reading is no longer a controlled experience, but allows for the reader to explore. There is a sense of play or discovery.\n- Structuring narrative through love and death. Behind comedy there is a notion of great mystery.\n- Plays with the stereotype of active male and passive female\n- The responsibilities of the writer, reader, and critic: It is a gift exchange that goes both ways between reader and writer. The critic extends the reading. Brian: Notion of ideal reading assumes ideal reader. Robert Kroetsch: agrees and resists the ideal reading, through the gift exchange has surrendered himself to the reader. There is no ideal context for reading.\n- Robert Kroetsch writes poetry by resisting poetry. Deprivileging the word and the role of the writer. An interest in language.

Robert Kroetsch begins speaking at 2:11. The last time he was in the building was fifteen years ago doing research for Badlands, and is going to read from Badlands as a sort of thank you. First came upon the material by accident while travelling around Alberta, the kind of story he likes to parody in his writing, but through the archive came to have a sympathy for the men. Reads the beginning and the end, narrated by the daughter of William Dawe.\n- \u201cSeed Catalogue\u201d: Reflection on uncle asking \u201cdon\u2019t you understand anything?\u201d Robert Kroetsch notes that he\u2019s been writing poems ever since trying to understand, and that perhaps he was right\n- \u201cDelphi\u201d: The only place where the oracle spoke in a human, female voice. There are four voices in this poem: Robert Kroetsch, quotes from Pausanias, commentary by Sir James Fraser, poem called \u201cThe Eggplant Poems.\u201d\n- Excerpts: Using country music, the \u201churting song.\u201d Short prose entries that look like diary entries, intrigued by the authority that we grant to the diary entry.\n- Excerpts: anecdote on writers spending a good deal of their time travelling - [00:40:40] \n- Advice: Suppressed stories of his mother, a photograph given to him of his mother produced all these poems.\n- Question period: The questions are not very discernable. First question about what he is writing, Robert Kroetsch answers \u201cnot really,\u201d that he is writing a novel that is unendable and not about the prairies, also his study of narrative. Second question, going back to Athens and Greece. Notes that he goes back quite frequently as he is married to a Greek woman. Third question about Advice as very different from his other writing. Robert Kroetsch responds that his voice between Field Notes (as personal) and Advice (as a persona) are in fact very different. Fourth question indiscernible, Robert Kroetsch responds that he doesn\u2019t believe that poetry is dead, that poetry ought to be accessible to all. Fifth question indiscernible, Robert Kroetsch responds that this period of reading may be an aberration in the history of language and that we may go back to more elaborate readings. A return to the hearing of poems instead of the reading of poems.\n", "contents": "Robert Kroetsch\n[00:04:33]\nReads excerpts from Badlands.\nRobert Kroetsch\n[00:14:20]\nReads excerpts from Field Notes.\nRobert Kroetsch\n[00:15:30]\nReads from \"Seed Catalogue\".\nRobert Kroetsch\n[00:20:30]\nReads from \"Delphi Commentary\".\nRobert Kroetsch\n[00:35:27]\nReads excerpts from the Real World.\nRobert Kroetsch\n[00:44:12]\nReads excerpts from the end of Advice to My Friends."}, "Creators": [{"id": 1, "url": "http://viaf.org/viaf/120613489", "name": "Kroetsch, Robert", "role": [{"id": "66b3866a6935f6.38249911", "value": "Author"}, {"id": "66b3866a693ba4.84954155", "value": "Performer"}], "dates": "1927-2011"}], "Location": [{"id": 1, "venue": "National Library of Canada", "address": "Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"}], "Contributors": [{"id": 1}], "Related_Works": [{"id": 1, "citation": "Badlands; Field Notes; Excerpts from the Real World; Advice to My Friends"}], "Item_Description": {"genre": [{"id": "66b3866a691235.88122617", "value": "Reading: Poetry"}], "title": "Robert Kroetsch", "language": "English", "title_note": "Professional box with marbled paper, embossed stamp, and leather embossed title.", "identifiers": [{"id": "66b3866a691973.22245616", "value": "29.11"}], "swallow1_id": "16072", "title_source": "Transcribed from the artifact", "source_item_ID": "775/04.25", "production_context": "Classroom recording"}, "Material_Description": [{"id": 1, "side": "A", "extent": "1/8 inch", "AV_type": "Audio", "tape_brand": "Sony", "sound_quality": "Good", "recording_type": "Analogue", "physical_condition": "Good", "material_designation": "Cassette", "physical_composition": "Magnetic Tape", "other_physical_description": "Somewhat grainy."}], "Digital_File_Description": [{"id": 1, "size": "953.11 MB", "duration": "T00:57:50", "filename": "RK_Acc_775_04.25.29-11"}]}, {"schema": "Swallow JSON", "schema_definition": "spoken_web", "swallow_id": "8378", "create_date": "2024-09-09 12:43:12", "last_modified": "2024-09-09 12:43:13", "cataloguer": {"name": "Leah", "lastname": "Van Dyk"}, "classification": [{"label": "Robert Kroetsch fonds", "URI": "", "id": "214", "parent_id": "13", "Contributing Unit": "University of Calgary, Archives and Special Collections", "Source Collection": "Robert Kroetsch fonds", "Source Collection Description": "", "Source Collection ID": "", "Persistent URL": "https://searcharchives.ucalgary.ca/robert-kroetsch-fonds", "Collection Image URL": "", "Old Swallow1 ID": "", "class_name": "collection"}, {"label": "University of Calgary", "URI": "", "id": "13", "parent_id": "0", "description": "", "class_name": "partner institution"}], "Dates": [{"id": 1, "date": "2002", "type": "Performance Date", "notes": "Dates supplied through research for copyright."}], "Notes": [{"id": 1}], "Rights": {"notes": "Enters Public Domain at the end of 2052", "rights": "In Copyright (InC)", "rights_uri": "http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/"}, "Content": {"notes": "- Introduction of Robert Kroetsch and Cooley by Jim Andrews.\n- Discussion of his article \u201cThe Vernacular Muse.\u201d\n- Reading of \u201cMaking Up\u201d from Bloody Jack to use as an argument in relation to \u201cVernacular.\u201d The centrality of pun. \n- Erotics between the poet and language, \u201cYou With the Stars\u2026\u201d.

The audience looking at the object of the jar is very much like the audience of the poem, compelled yet somewhat resisting.\n- Connection between being a poet and working as an editor. Discussing small presses and the state of publishing in Canada.\n- \u201cMuse\u201d: How do you write an elegy which resists consolation? Grief as silence.\n- No acts are a-political, including literature.\n", "contents": "Jim Andrews\n[00:00:00]\nIntroduces Robert Kroetsch and Dennis Cooley.\nRobert Kroetsch\n[00:04:08]\nBegins Interview with and Dennis Cooley.\nDennis Cooley\n[00:06:00]\nReads \"Making Up\" from Bloody Jack.\nDennis Cooley\n[00:10:25]\nReads \"You With the Stars in Your Eyes\".\nDennis Cooley\n[00:12:33]\nReads \"Strobic Flies\".\nDennis Cooley\n[00:21:55]\nReads \"A Curse on a Critic\".\nDennis Cooley\n[00:25:57]\nEND Side 1\nJim Andrews and second side.\nJim Andrews\n[00:27:30]\nReads \"Vernacular Muse\".\nRobert Kroetsch\n[00:33:35]\nResumes interview.\nDennis Cooley\n[00:35:36]\nReads \"Sonia Orlauski\".\nDennis Cooley\n[00:44:15]\nReads \"The Muse of Absence\"."}, "Creators": [{"id": 1, "url": "http://viaf.org/viaf/120613489", "name": "Kroetsch, Robert", "role": [{"id": "66b3866a6e08d3.98071335", "value": "Interviewer"}], "dates": "1927-2011"}], "Location": [{"id": 1, "venue": "CFUV Radio, University of Victoria", "address": "Victoria, British Columbia, Canada"}], "Contributors": [{"id": 1, "url": "http://viaf.org/viaf/32011503", "name": "Cooley, Dennis", "role": [{"id": "66b3866a6e2a44.46359416", "value": "Speaker"}], "dates": "-1944"}], "Related_Works": [{"id": 1, "citation": "Bloody Jack"}], "Item_Description": {"genre": [{"id": "66b3866a6de1d2.49389678", "value": "Reading: Poetry"}, {"id": "66b3866a6de6d3.76587702", "value": "Interview"}], "title": "Fine Lines #87, Robert Kroetsch interviews Dennis Cooley", "language": "English", "title_note": "Fine Lines program, listing contents of recording.", "identifiers": [{"id": "66b3866a6dedb2.22330112", "value": "29.12"}], "swallow1_id": "16073", "title_source": "Transcribed from the artifact", "source_item_ID": "775/04.25", "production_context": "Broadcast"}, "Material_Description": [{"id": 1, "side": "A and B", "extent": "1/8 inch", "AV_type": "Audio", "tape_brand": "Unknown acetate", "sound_quality": "Good", "recording_type": "Analogue", "physical_condition": "Good", "material_designation": "Cassette", "physical_composition": "Magnetic Tape"}], "Digital_File_Description": [{"id": 1, "size": "1.01 GB", "duration": "T01:02:49", "filename": "RK_Acc_775_04.25.29-12"}]}, {"schema": "Swallow JSON", "schema_definition": "spoken_web", "swallow_id": "8379", "create_date": "2024-09-09 12:43:12", "last_modified": "2024-09-09 12:43:13", "cataloguer": {"name": "Leah", "lastname": "Van Dyk"}, "classification": [{"label": "Robert Kroetsch fonds", "URI": "", "id": "214", "parent_id": "13", "Contributing Unit": "University of Calgary, Archives and Special Collections", "Source Collection": "Robert Kroetsch fonds", "Source Collection Description": "", "Source Collection ID": "", "Persistent URL": "https://searcharchives.ucalgary.ca/robert-kroetsch-fonds", "Collection Image URL": "", "Old Swallow1 ID": "", "class_name": "collection"}, {"label": "University of Calgary", "URI": "", "id": "13", "parent_id": "0", "description": "", "class_name": "partner institution"}], "Dates": [{"id": 1, "date": "1988", "type": "Performance Date", "notes": "Dates taken from container and/or accompanying material."}], "Notes": [{"id": 1}], "Rights": {"notes": "Enters Public Domain at the end of 2041", "rights": "In Copyright (InC)", "rights_uri": "http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/"}, "Content": {"notes": "- A weeklong poetry workshop in August 1991.
